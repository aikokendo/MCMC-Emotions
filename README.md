# MCMC-Emotions
## Final Project Description

mplement a device/system diagnosis system to infer the unknown fault hypothesis of the device using BBN (Bayesian belief networks)

1)   Select a domain of a device (printer, car, computer, etc.) as a target problem domain.
2)   Identify the causal state variables in the target problem domain to form a belief network with their causality links.
3)   Establish CPT by assigning the subjective/objective probability entries on CPT for each link.
4)   Implement the MCMC algorithm and simulate the conditional Bayesian probability inference by sampling given evidence input as facts known in the domain.
5)   Evaluate your BBN to see how accurate the diagnosis hypothesis with respect to various evidence conditions observed

# MCMC-Emotions
## Final Project Description

Implement a device/system diagnosis system to infer the unknown fault hypothesis of the device using BBN (Bayesian belief networks)

*   Select a domain of a device (printer, car, computer, etc.) as a target problem domain.
*   Identify the causal state variables in the target problem domain to form a belief network with their causality links.
*   Establish CPT by assigning the subjective/objective probability entries on CPT for each link.
*   Implement the MCMC algorithm and simulate the conditional Bayesian probability inference by sampling given evidence input as facts known in the domain.
*   Evaluate your BBN to see how accurate the diagnosis hypothesis with respect to various evidence conditions observed
